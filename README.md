Overview

This project leverages unsupervised machine learning to segment customers based on key features like Income, NumStorePurchases, and Total_Spending. By applying K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, it achieves a silhouette score of 0.6153 with five clusters, optimized to three for actionable insights. Integrated with a CRM system, it boosts engagement and sales through targeted strategies.

Key Features

Robust Clustering: Optimized K-Means (k=3) with a silhouette score of ~ 0.5, alongside Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN for comprehensive analysis.
Feature Engineering: Handled outliers and selected features like Income and NumStorePurchases for high-quality segmentation.
Visualizations: Includes scatter plots, t-SNE, and stacked bar plots for intuitive cluster interpretation.
Business Impact: CRM integration drives personalized marketing, increasing customer engagement and sales.

Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy for data processing and clustering.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for insightful plots.
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git for version control.
